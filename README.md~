This project includes OpenSCAD source files to create various parts of the 3D printed project.

OpenSCAD can be downloaded from http://openscad.org/.

Also intermediate files are included in the repository for reference. The STL files from OpenSCAD and gcode files from slicer programs is also included.

For slicing, two different programs are used.
Repsnapper - an all-in-one 3D printing program. Can be cloned from Git at https://github.com/timschmidt/repsnapper.git. The printer control functions of Repsnapper aren't fully functional yet but the slicer function is OK and is reliable.
Slic3r - rapidly developing slicer program. When working, gives very good results but has some strange bugs so can't be relied on. The developer released v 1.0.0 stable after a while which appears to give great results. Can be cloned from Git at https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r.git
GCODE files generally have comments for which slicer generated it.
